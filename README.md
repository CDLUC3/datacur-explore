# Data curation exploration code

We began sharing code in colab, but those notebooks become annoying to work with
for code longer than a short size and it's better to split code cleanly into classes/modules
and other structures beyond writing testing or toy code.

The repo is for sharing small exploratory projects and shouldn't be considered robust
production code.

As needs are defined more, we may open real projects.
