# README for the Dataset: "How Little We’ve Seen: A Visual Coverage Estimate of the Deep Seafloor"

## Dataset Overview

This dataset, titled "How Little We’ve Seen: A Visual Coverage Estimate of the Deep Seafloor", is compiled to assess the visual coverage of the deep seafloor, specifically focusing on the regions captured by visual surveys conducted by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences. The data provides insights into the seafloor's geomorphological characteristics and depths, which aids in understanding unexplored areas of marine environments.

## Files Included

- **Bell et al SciAdv How Little We’ve Seen- A Visual Coverage Estimate of the Deep Seafloor- DSV dataset v2.csv**

## Description of Data

The primary file, a CSV document, contains detailed records of various seafloor survey expeditions. In this document, each row represents a unique survey instance, with the following columns provided:

- **OBJECTID_GIS**: A unique identifier for each survey record.
- **Latitude** and **Longitude**: Removed on a public dataset due to potential sensitivity; contact the institution for precise locations.
- **Institution**: The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, responsible for conducting the surveys.
- **Platform**: Describes the type of equipment used, such as "Deep BRUVs drop camera" and "Maka Nui."
- **Type**: Designates the method used in each survey, like a "Lander."
- **Country**: The country where the survey originates, in this case, Bermuda.
- **Year**: The year during which the survey was conducted.
- **Type_Original** and **Platform_Original**: Additional description of the type and platform providing historical context.
- **Jurisdiction**: Indicates the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) where the survey took place.
- **Sovereign**: References the United Kingdom's jurisdiction over the surveyed region.
- **DepthToUse**: The depth at which the survey was conducted in meters, indicating the depth zone ranging from 200-2000 meters.
- **DepthZone**: Categorical representation of the depth, e.g., "Between 200-1000m."
- **Decade**: Temporal categorization based on survey year.
- **Geomorphology Description**: Provides geomorphic identity of the seafloor, mostly described as "Ridge."

## Usage Notes

- **Data Access**: For specific location data (latitude and longitude), please contact the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences. This detail is restricted in this public dataset for confidentiality reasons.
- **Data Analysis**: This dataset is useful for geospatial and marine exploration research, specifically for understanding underrepresented regions of the deep seafloor.
- **Interconnectivity**: Users can correlate specific survey platforms with particular depth zones or geomorphological features using this data.

## Important Considerations

- **Confidentiality**: Please note that geospatial coordinates are omitted in this version. If detailed location information is required for research purposes, direct communication with the institution is necessary.
- **Data Integrity**: Each entry maintains accurate records of the surveyed regions' metric depths and geomorphological features necessary for comprehensive seafloor mapping and analysis.
