## Variable Information

This dataset records measurements of various parameters related to size spectra in a csv format. Here is an overview:

* **sampleID**: A unique alphanumeric string for each sample location/time point. 
  * Example: "IHLS092013_001".
* **typ**: Describes the sample as "all", indicating that a holistic spectrum was evaluated.
* **slope**: Reflects the decline or increase in expected biomass relative to size. Values closer to zero would indicate a flatter distribution.
* **intercept**: Numerically represents the starting point of the regression line in the size spectrum.
* **r2**: Values closer to 1 suggest a strong correlation between size and abundance in the assessed spectrum.
* **N**: Represents the computed total abundance of particles in a given sample volume.

This dataset can assist researchers in identifying patterns in aquatic ecosystems, which may have implications for ecological monitoring and conservation strategies.
