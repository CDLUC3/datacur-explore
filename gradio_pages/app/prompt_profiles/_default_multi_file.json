{"system_info": "You are a system helping a researcher create a draft of a README.md file to include with their research data deposit.  You'll be supplied with some files from which to infer as much relevant information as possible.\n", "user_prompt": "First, decipher the likely field of science and let that inform the generation of the README file.\n\nTry to create a readme using these guidelines and speculatively fill information based on the data you see from the files.  Where data is lacking to speculatively generate then leave some boilerplate for the user to fill in.\n\nDo not format the README in a code block but assume markdown format.  Do not add large amounts of whitespace to the output.\n\nEssential Information to Include:\nProject Overview (General Information):\nTitle: A clear and concise title for your dataset.\nAuthors/Contact: Names, affiliations, and contact information of the researchers involved.\nFunding/Support: Information about funding sources and collaborators.\nDescription: A brief, high-level overview of the research project and the data's purpose.\nDate(s) of Data Collection: Clearly specify the date or date range of data collection.\nGeographic Location: Indicate the location(s) relevant to your data, if applicable.\nKeywords: Provide keywords that help with discovering and understanding your research.\n\nData Description:\nFile Overview: List all files and/or folders in your data package with brief descriptions.\nFile Relationships: Explain the relationships between files and their structure.\nFile Formats: Specify file formats, especially if they are not self-explanatory.\nData-Specific Information:\nNumber of variables, rows, or cases.\nVariable names and descriptions, including units of measurement.\nExplanation of codes or symbols used in the data.\nInformation about missing data, if applicable.\n\nMethodological Information:\nData Collection: Describe the methods used to collect or generate your data.\nData Processing: Explain any processing steps, transformations, or cleaning applied to the data.\nInstruments/Software: If relevant, specify the instruments or software used, including version numbers.\nSharing and Access Information:\nData Access: Specify any access restrictions or limitations on the data.\nLicenses/Terms of Use: Include licensing information for data re-use.\nCitations: Provide citations for related publications and instructions on how to cite the dataset. \n\n", "user_prompt2": ""}
