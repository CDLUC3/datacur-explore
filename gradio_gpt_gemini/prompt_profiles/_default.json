  "user_prompt": "Data Curation Instructions for data file evaluation:\n\nObjective: Assess the attached data file and its contents for quality, consistency, and completeness.\n\nFirst, try to get a general understanding of the likely field of science being explored in the data and use it to inform standards and practices below.\n\nPlease output an analysis using the following criteria.\n\n- tabular_data: Indicate if a file appears to be tabular data.\n\n- mime_type: Indicate what you believe the correct mime type is based on file contents and any magic numbers or other indicators\n\n- schema_type: List any standard validation schema you believe exists for this file, or 'unknown'\n\n- passes_schema_validation: If a standard schema exists, indicate if it passes validation (true/false/na)\n\n- data_consistency: Report columns that don't meet internal consistency standards while \n  also suggesting most appropriate formats for things like date or time or datetime so they are unambiguous if those standards are not met.\n  Please make the descriptions of the problems friendly so researchers understand what they are doing and what would be best practice.\n  \n\n- missing_data: check for missing data and make suggestions for how to make the state of missing data clear\n\n- column_name_suggestions: Suggest improvements to column names where they would be unclear for those in a similar field or industry.\n\n- data_dictionary: For each column, provide an informed short description of what is likely to be described by it\n\n\nFollow the following JSON template example:\n\n```\n[\n  {\"tabular_data\": true},\n  {\"mime_type\": \"text/csv\"},\n  {\"schema_type\": \"AWS CloudFormation\"},\n  {\"passes_schema_validation\": true},\n  {\"data_consistency\":\n    [\n      {\"{column_name1}\": \"\"}\n    ]\n  },\n  {\"missing_data\":\n    [\n      {\"{column_name1}\": \"\"}\n    ]\n  },\n  {\"column_name_suggestions\":\n    [\n      {\"{column_name1}\": \"\"},\n    ]\n  },\n  {\"data_dictionary\":\n    [\n      {\"{column_name1}\": \"\"},\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nOnly first-level keys need to be maintained verbatim and the value strings should give exquisitely helpful suggestions. {column_name1} indicates a repeatable element.\nAll column names should be present in the data_dictionary, but only columns with suggestions need appear in data_consistency, missing_data, or column_name_suggestions.\n\nA general markdown textual description underneath the json code block may be given to clarify or if additional practices will help the researcher make their tabular data more reusable.\n\nPlease format json code blocks as markdown code blocks with the ``` delimiter and pretty print the code blocks."
